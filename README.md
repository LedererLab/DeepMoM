# DeepMoM

DeepMom is a pipeline for robust deep learning.
It is described here: [DeepMoM: Robust Deep Learning With Median-of-Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14035).
This repository provides the corresponding implementations.

## Simulations

The code in `SimulationsRegression.R` provides a comparison of least-squares, Huber, and least-absolute deviation estimators to our ReLU-based DeepMoM estimators in regression problems;
the code in `SimulationsClassification.R` provides a comparison of soft-max cross-entropy estimators to our ReLU-based DeepMoM estimators in classification problems. (The simulation can take a while to complete on a single machine.)

## Applications

The code in `TcgaApplication.R` applies DeepMoM to seven TCGA data sets. (Takes a while to complete if on a single machine.)

## Other folders

**AdditionalFunctions**: The source code of the functions required for computing DeepMoM.

**TcgaData**: The TCGA data sets.
