# DeepMoM

This repository provides the implementations of the methods described in [DeepMoM: Robust Deep Learning With Median-of-Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14035).

## Estimator

We provide an example code in `TrainNN.R` for computing DeepMoM estimator with Relu activation. Developed for `R 4.1.2`.


## Simulations

We provide an example code in `SimulationStudy.R` for a comparison of least-squars, Huber, and least absolute deviation estimators with ReLU based DeepMoM estimators for regression type problems and another code in `Classifier.R` for comparison of soft-max cross entropy estimators and ReLU based DeepMoM estimators for classification tasks. 

## Applications

We provide an example code in `TCGA.R` to apply the DeepMoM structure on seven TCGA data sets.

The data is available in `TCGAlist.RData`.
